# 30-Days-of-Code

Welcome to the C++ 30 Days of Code repository! This repository contains a collection of 30 coding challenges in C++ designed to enhance your programming skills and deepen your understanding of the C++ language.

## How to Use
Each day of the challenge is organized in a separate folder, starting from Day 1 to Day 30. Inside each folder, you'll find a C++ source file (dayX.cpp) and a corresponding input file (inputX.txt) that contains sample inputs for the challenge. Additionally, there may be a README.md file providing a detailed description of the problem and any additional instructions.

To start the challenge, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the corresponding day's folder (e.g., Day1).
2. Open the dayX.cpp file in your favorite C++ IDE or editor.
3. Read the problem description in the README.md file to understand the requirements.
4. Implement your solution in the dayX.cpp file.
5. Test your solution using the provided sample inputs in the inputX.txt file.
6. You can modify the inputX.txt file or create additional test cases for further testing.
7. Compile and run the dayX.cpp file to see the output of your solution.
8. Iterate and refine your solution until you are satisfied with the results.
Feel free to customize the code or add your own test cases to further explore and practice your C++ programming skills.
